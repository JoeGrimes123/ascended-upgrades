<h1 align="center">AscendedUpgrades</h1>

Adds special Ascended Upgrades that you can use to infinitely upgrade towers.

When a tower has no more available upgrades, you can begin choosing between 3 repeatable Ascended Upgrades to continue powering it up. Each Ascended Upgrade you use increases the cost of future ones.
